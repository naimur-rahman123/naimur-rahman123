### <img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/VgCDAzcKvsR6OM0uWg/giphy.gif" width="60"> A little more about me...
<p align="left">I didn't study Computer Science. In fact, I studied Electrical & Electronic Engineering at my university, RUET. During first semester of my University after taking first programming course, programming became a passion of mine and I got hooked. I spend eight to ten hours a day in front of a computer screen as I am coding, debugging, or discussing coding practices and methods with other programmers. I started competetive programming just for fun and later won more 3 University Level Programming Contests. I have a decent knowledge in Data Structures and Algorithms. I have experience working with other developers on real client projects. When I am not programming, I am teaching about computers at the university helping others to learn programming and making others become interested in technologies or I am joing Tech Festivals. I do enjoy my work.😊</p>
